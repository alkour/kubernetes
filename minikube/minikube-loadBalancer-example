//To access a LoadBalancer deployment, use the “minikube tunnel” command. Here is an example deployment:

>kubectl create deployment balanced --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0
>kubectl expose deployment balanced --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080


//In another window, start the tunnel to create a routable IP for the ‘balanced’ deployment:

>minikube tunnel

//To find the routable IP, run this command and examine the EXTERNAL-IP column:

>kubectl get services balanced

//Your deployment is now available at <EXTERNAL-IP>:8080
